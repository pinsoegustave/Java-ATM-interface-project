ATM INTERFACE PROGRAM : How to run the program in Java.

Sure! To run an ATM interface program written in Java, you'll first need to make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. Once you have that installed, follow these steps:

1. **Download the ATM interface program code**: Uou'll need to first download the codes on my github repository.

2. **Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You can use any text editor like Notepad or a specialized Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans to open the ATM interface program files.

3. **Compile the Java file**: Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your Java file is located. Then, use the Java compiler (`javac`) to compile the Java file. For example:
   ```
   javac Java-ATM-interface-project 
   ```
4. **Run the compiled Java program**: After successful compilation, you'll find a `.class` file in the same directory. To execute the program, use the `java` command followed by the name of the main class (usually the same as the file name without the `.java` extension). For example:
   ```
   java Main
   ```
5. **Follow the prompts**: Once you run the program, it should start the ATM interface. Follow the prompts on the screen to interact with the ATM.
